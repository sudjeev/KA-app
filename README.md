# KA-app: Infection Project

[Check out the live demo!](https://dry-ravine-36414.herokuapp.com/Infection)

This is the repository for my solution to the Khan Academy Infection Project.

I tried to build this java application so that it could hypothetically be used by a company such as Khan Academy 
to help decide exactly what percentage of users should receive a new version of the website, and what the tradeoffs
are for such a decision.

The first part of the project asked for an implementation of Total Infection: where if one node in a graph component 
gets infected, all the other nodes in the same component also become infected. 

My solution to this specific section can be seen in the function totalInfection in [Infection.java](https://github.com/sudjeev/KA-app/blob/master/src/main/java/Infection.java).
Here I am simply using a Linked List to do a Breadth First Search, infecting all UserNodes in the component starting from 
the given node.

The next part of the project, Limited Infection, is a little more open ended. Specifically we are asked to:
  
  <i>
  "We would like to be able to infect close to a given number of users. 
  Ideally weâ€™d like a coach and all of their students to either have a feature or not. 
  However, that might not always be possible. Implement a procedure for limited infection."
  </i>

To solve this problem I wrote two functions limitedInfection and exactInfection in [Infection.java](https://github.com/sudjeev/KA-app/blob/master/src/main/java/Infection.java).

<b>limitedInfection:</b> This function will try to get as close as possible to the percentage of users we want to infect only using the function <i>totalInfection</i>.
This means that no single graph component will have users on different version of the site, guaranteeing a better user experience.
However the tradeoff is that it is entirely possible that we will not be able to infect the exact percentage users we wanted.

This is where the second function comes in!

<b>exactInfection:</b> This function guarantees that the exact percentage of users that we want to infect will be infected. 
  This is done in two parts:
    1. First, we see how close we can get to our desired percentage by only totally infecting full components. Once we reach 
       the point where infecting another full component will infect more users that our desired percentage; we stop and move to step 2. 
    2. Here we see how many users we still need to infect in order to hit out percentage. Then, all uninfected nodes are put into a 
       PriorityQueue which sorts nodes by the number of direct connections they have (least connections first). Finally we simply dequeue
       and infect as many nodes as we need to reach our desired percentage.

The good thing about exactInfection is that we are guaranteed to infect the desired the number of users. The tradeoff is that some of the
infected users will be in a component with users on a different version of the site, potentially compromising overall user experience.

To quantify the negative impact of exactInfection I also wrote the function <b>countUpsetUsers</b> in [Graph.java](https://github.com/sudjeev/KA-app/blob/master/src/main/java/Graph.java).
This basically shows how many users are at risk of a bad site experience by counting the number of edges between users on different versions
of the website.
